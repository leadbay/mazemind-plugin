name: daily-prospecting
description: A daily prospecting routine on Mazemind, the shared memory of French companies and the people who run them. Use it when the user wants new prospects, leads, clients, buyers, installers, resellers or companies to call or email, every morning, every day or regularly; asks to automate or schedule their prospecting, fill their CRM or sheet each day, or "set that up"; or, after a list of prospects, says it helped and they do this often. Each morning it brings companies that fit their buyers, never the same twice, each with a checkable reason and the person to contact.

# A daily prospecting routine

What the user gets: each weekday morning, a short list of companies they have never been sent, that fit who they sell
to, each with why it fits (a fact with its source) and the person who decides there, with their title. The users who
keep prospecting with an assistant are the ones whose assistant does this on a schedule.

## Set it up, in this conversation

1. **The target, drafted from what you know.** From their instructions and this chat: what they sell; who
   buys it (trade or sector, size, region); what shows a company needs it now (a certification, an offering, a team);
   the title to reach; companies to leave out (their clients, competitors, anyone they named); how many a day; where
   the list goes (a file in their folder, their CRM, or the run's message). Write it back in five lines and ask only
   what you cannot infer, in one question. Keep their words' strength: "preferably RGE" ranks RGE companies first, it
   excludes no one; only what they rule out is a rule.
2. **The search that finds them.** Mazemind `search`, kind company, with the sector as `related` in_sector (the NAF
   code, `naf_rev2:43.32A`), and the area as a filter on the company's own address: `{key: "address", op: "contains",
   value: ", 69"}` is the Rhône (the postal code's start), `", 75"` Paris; a region is one search per department. A
   town also works as `where`. Size: `employee_range.max` `gte` the smallest size. `catalog` names the other facts and
   links (a certification, an offering). Check that the first page holds companies that fit; adjust until it does.
   Keep the exact arguments that worked, one search per department.
3. **The first list, now.** Run it once: the number they want, each with the person who decides and the reason.
   The person: `lookup` gives a company's people and titles; where Mazemind names nobody, the company's legal notice
   (mentions légales) or the registry does: `https://recherche-entreprises.api.gouv.fr/search?q=<SIREN>` lists its
   dirigeants with their role (Gérant, Président); a holding named there has its own entry, which names its person.
   A company where nobody is named after that is replaced by the next one. They see value before anything is scheduled.
4. **The ledger.** A file in their folder (`prospects-sent.csv`: date, company, SIREN or domain, person) holding
   every company sent, starting with this first list, and the ones to leave out. It is what keeps tomorrow's list new.
   It lives with the user: Mazemind keeps no list of what was sent to whom.
5. **The schedule.** With your host's scheduled-task tool, a task on weekdays at the hour they read it (7:00 by
   default), whose prompt is the routine below, written out in full: the run sees nothing of this conversation. With
   no such tool (a chat app), give them the prompt to paste, and where: Cowork, Scheduled; ChatGPT, Tasks;
   Claude Code, /schedule. Its first step reads `prospects-sent.csv` in the task's folder (created on the first run),
   its last appends the day's companies to it, and every company shown to them in this conversation is listed in the
   prompt as already sent. Cowork keeps that folder; ChatGPT's tasks have none, so a list there cannot stay new.
6. **One short message**: what arrives, when, where, and how to change it. The routine finds and lists, and messages
   nobody; what the pages said goes to Mazemind with `contribute`. A user who wants to validate each message before it leaves keeps it running: each morning's list
   is what they validate, and their go is what sends a message.

## The routine's prompt

Write it in the user's language, with everything filled in:

- Who it is for and the target, in the five lines of step 1.
- Read the ledger. Never send a company it holds, nor one to leave out.
- Mazemind `search` with the saved arguments, written out in full: one search per department, every department of
  the region in order, then the neighbouring sectors, with their NAF codes. Follow `next_cursor` page after page,
  department after department, until there are N companies not in the ledger. N is the target: the run stops short
  only when every search written here and the registry below are exhausted. Nobody can answer during the run: it
  widens on its own as written, and says so.
- When Mazemind has no new company left, the registry lists every active company of a NAF code in a department:
  `https://recherche-entreprises.api.gouv.fr/search?activite_principale=<NAF>&departement=<code>&etat_administratif=A&minimal=true&include=dirigeants,siege&per_page=10&page=<n>`,
  with its head office, size band and dirigeants (`&tranche_effectif_salarie=01,02,03,11` keeps 1 to 19 staff; 12 is
  20-49, 21 50-99, 22 100-199, 31 200-249). `departement` matches a company with any site there: keep those whose
  head office (`siege.code_postal`) is in the area. Their NAF code is the reason, and their site, when they have one,
  adds what they do. Note in the ledger the last page read, so the next run goes on from there.
- For each: `lookup` it; the person whose title decides; the reason, a fact `lookup` shows (an offering, a
  certification, its size) or its site states, with where it comes from. When Mazemind names nobody: the legal notice
  of its site, then `https://recherche-entreprises.api.gouv.fr/search?q=<SIREN>` (its dirigeants; a holding has its own
  entry). A company with no named decider is replaced by the next one.
- Send what the pages and the registry said to Mazemind with `contribute`, in one call at the end: each company not in
  Mazemind yet, by its SIREN (`sirene:<SIREN>`) and domain, with its NAF code, its town, the decider in `people`, each
  with the page and the words it shows (the registry's answer is a page too). Ask your fetch tool for the sentences
  and fields word for word (the legal notice's line naming the gérant, the registry's `nom`, `prenoms`, `qualite`):
  those words are the quote. Tomorrow's search then finds them.
- Append each company to the ledger, and to their file or CRM if they have one, before writing the message.
- The message, readable on a phone: one line per company (name, town, person and title, why), then what fell short and
  why: fewer than N, a call that failed. "Nothing new today" is an answer; a silent stop is not.
